🏡 Loan Approval Prediction System
📘 Overview

This project is a Loan Approval Prediction System built using Machine Learning.
It predicts whether a loan should be approved based on multiple applicant factors such as income, credit history, and loan amount.

Currently, the model achieves an 80% cross-validation accuracy, and I plan to improve it over time by adding better preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, and a frontend interface.

⚙️ Key Features

Handles both categorical and numerical data

Uses Pipelines for structured preprocessing

Applies data transformations like PowerTransformer and StandardScaler

Implements multiple ML algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)

Evaluates model using Cross-Validation

🧠 Machine Learning Techniques

Data Preprocessing: ColumnTransformer & Pipeline

Feature Scaling: StandardScaler

Outlier & Skewness Handling: PowerTransformer

Models Used:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy & Cross-Validation Score

🚀 Future Improvements

Increase model accuracy beyond 90%

Add a user-friendly frontend (Flask or Streamlit)

Deploy as a fully functional web app

Connect with a database for applicant record storage

Perform hyperparameter tuning for optimization

🧩 Tech Stack

Language: Python

Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

Environment: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

💡 How It Works

User provides input data (Income, Credit History, Loan Amount, etc.)

Data is preprocessed and scaled automatically using the trained pipeline

The model predicts whether the loan will be Approved (1) or Not Approved (0)

📈 Current Results

Cross-Validation Accuracy: ~80%

Next Goal: Achieve 90%+ accuracy with better tuning and more data
