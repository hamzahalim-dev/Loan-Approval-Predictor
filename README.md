🏡 Loan Approval Prediction System
📘 Overview

This project is a Loan Approval Prediction System that uses machine learning to predict whether a loan should be approved or not based on various applicant details such as income, credit history, loan amount, and more.

The model currently achieves an 80% cross-validation accuracy, and I plan to continuously improve it by optimizing preprocessing, trying more advanced models, and enhancing feature engineering.

⚙️ Features

Handles both categorical and numerical data

Uses pipelines for preprocessing

Applies data transformations (like PowerTransformer and StandardScaler)

Implements multiple ML algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.)

Provides cross-validation for model performance estimation

🧠 Machine Learning Techniques

Data Preprocessing using ColumnTransformer and Pipeline

Feature Scaling with StandardScaler

Outlier & Skewness Handling using PowerTransformer

Classification Models:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Cross-Validation Score

🚀 Future Plans

Improve model accuracy beyond 90%

Add a user-friendly frontend for live predictions

Deploy using Streamlit / Flask

Integrate with a database for storing applicant data

Continuous fine-tuning with feature selection and hyperparameter tuning

🧩 Tech Stack

Language: Python

Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

Tools: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

💡 How It Works

User provides input (like income, loan amount, credit history, etc.)

Data is preprocessed and transformed using the trained pipeline

Model predicts whether the loan is Approved (1) or Not Approved (0)

📈 Current Results

Cross-validation accuracy: ~80%

Next goal: Reach 90%+ accuracy with tuning & new data
